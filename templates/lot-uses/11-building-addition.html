{% block steps %}
    <ol>
        <li><p>You will need to hire a licensed architect and licensed general contractor to obtain the permits. Work with your architect to determine the Chicago Municipal Code’s requirements on height, size, construction materials, and property line setbacks.</p></li>
        <li><p>You will need approval from the Department of Zoning as well as a Standard Review Building Permit from the Department of Buildings.</p></li>
        <li><p>If you’re interested in using sustainable technologies, you will also need a Green Permit. This can expedite your other permit processes.</p></li>
        <li><p>If you will be renting out the new space to tenants, ensure your units are in accordance with the City of Chicago Residential Landlord and Tenant Ordinance</p></li>
    </ol>
