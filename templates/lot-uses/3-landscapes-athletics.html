{% block steps %}
    <ol>
        <li><p>Reach out to your homeowner’s insurance to determine how your privately owned lot can become a community-managed open space for use by the general public. You may need to make changes to your policy to protect yourself from liability.</p></li>
        <li><p>Certain “accessory buildings,” such as storage sheds, gazebos, and pergolas, require approval from Zoning, and possibly a permit from the Department of Buildings. The size and materials used to construct the structure will determine what approval process you’ll need. Get professional advice to find out. You may need to hire an architect and/or general contractor for a permit.</p></li>
        <li><p>Consider utility needs for light posts and waste receptacles. Make a plan to ensure a safe level of security 24/7 in the space. Renewable energy sources may help with providing site lighting and other amenities.</p></li>
    </ol>
