{% block steps %}
    <ol>
        <li><p>Talk to your design professional about whether your structure qualifies for the Easy Permit program, which requires a general contractor. You may need a Standard Plan Review Permit from the Department of Buildings, which requires both an architect and a general contractor. If you are an owner-occupant able to design and/or build it yourself to be fully code-compliant, you may be eligible to move forward without a registered architect with a Homeowner Assistance Permit.</p></li>
        <li><p>For a public greenhouse, be aware that a privately-owned, publicly accessible space may mean you need to change your lot’s zoning. Structures within community gardens have special rules, and most have a maximum area of 575 SF. Construction methods will define the permits needed for the structure.</p></li>
