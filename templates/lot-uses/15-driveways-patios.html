{% block steps %}
    <ol>
        <li><p>Permeable paving refers to a range of sustainable materials (including pervious concrete, porous asphalt, or brick-like paving stones) which have the advantage of allowing stormwater to pass through the paving and return to the soil below, rather than becoming runoff for the cityâ€™s sewers. It can look indistinguishable from non-porous paving but helps filter pollutants and improves our water quality.</p></li>
        <li><p>If you are an owner-occupant able to design and/or build it yourself to be fully code-compliant, you may be eligible to move forward without a registered contractor via the Homeowner Assistance Permit process. Otherwise, you will at least require a general contractor.</p></li>
        <li><p>Talk to your design professional about whether your paving qualifies for the Easy Permit program, which requires a licensed general contractor.</p></li>
    </ol>
