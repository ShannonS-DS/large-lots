{% block steps %}
    <ol>
        <li><p>You will need to negotiate additional insurance for the public playground you wish to create, both as it pertains to inviting the public on private land as well as relating to injuries on the equipment. By establishing a community organization for playground users, you may be able to reduce your liability if members of the organization sign a waiver and/or contribute a membership fee to offset higher insurance costs. Talk to your insurer. Homeowners Associations have accomplished this in the past.</p></li>
        <li><p>Talk to your design professional about whether you will need an architect as well as a general contractor for the playground, hardscape areas and foundations. </p></li>
    </ol>
