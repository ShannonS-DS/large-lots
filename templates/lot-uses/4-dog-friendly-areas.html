{% block steps %}
    <ol>
        <li><p>Review the Chicago Park District’s “Dog Friendly Areas Manual for Development.” Although you will not need to go through the same formal process that applies to Park District owned land, many general considerations and proposed rules for dog areas are pertinent.</p></li>
        <li><p>You will need to negotiate additional insurance for your dog friendly area, both as it pertains to inviting the public on private land as well as relating to potential animal attacks. By establishing a community organization for dog owners, you may be able to reduce your liability if members of the organization sign a waiver and/or contribute a membership fee to offset higher insurance costs. Talk to your insurer. </p></li>
        <li><p>Talk to your design professional about whether you will need a landscape architect as well as a general contractor for hardscape areas and foundations for fixed furniture.</p></li>
    </ol>
