    <h3><i class='fa fa-fw fa-file-text-o'></i> What steps is it going to involve?</h3>

    <ol>
        <li><p>Get professional advice and see the City of Chicago’s Urban Agriculture FAQ to determine how to get zoning approval for community agriculture.</p></li>
        <li><p>The City of Chicago defines Community Gardens differently from how it defines Urban Farms. Community Gardens are typically operated non-profit by volunteers, and cannot exceed 25,000 SF in area. Urban Farms are commercial operations with a business license.</p></li>
        <li><p>Certain “accessory buildings,” such as sheds, hoop houses, and greenhouses, require approval from Zoning, and possibly a permit. The size and materials used will determine what approval process you’ll need. You may need to hire an architect and/or general contractor for a permit. Get professional advice.</p></li>
        <li><p>Research and connect with nearby community gardens in your area through the Chicago Community Gardener Association (CCGA) to foster a strong volunteer team.</p></li>
    </ol>
