{% block steps %}
    <ol>
        <li><p>Many pools and water features need approval from the Department of Zoning, the Department of Buildings, and the Department of Water Management. Consult a design professional regarding permits.</p></li>
        <li><p>The City of Chicago defines “private residential swimming pools” as pools deeper than 42 inches. Pools require more extensive permit process for safety reasons. In Chicago, pools must be drained of water from Sept 15 to May 30. Permanent pools require an architect.</p></li>
        <li><p>Hot tubs, defined as hydromassage pools under 42” with filters, heaters, and blowers, may be either above or in-ground, pre-packaged or custom. Hot tubs are not required to be drained like pools.</p></li>
        <li><p>Ornamental pools or ponds are typically 2 to 3 feet in depth, not exceeding 42”. The City of Chicago code typically refers to such ponds as “fountains.” A Certified Aquascape Contractor is recommended.</p></li>
    </ol>
