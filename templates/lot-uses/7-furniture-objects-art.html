{% block steps %}
    <ol>
        <li><p>If you are considering these fixed objects for private use only, consult a design professional, as you may simply need an Easy Permit to proceed (or even no permit at all).</p></li>
        <li><p>You may need to hire a licensed general contractor, typically if your object (such as a post for a basketball hoop) requires some kind of foundation.</p></li>
        <li><p>If you plan to have the public onto your privately-owned land, talk to your homeowner’s insurance company about changes you will want to make in your policy to protect yourself from this change in liability.</p></li>
        <li><p>By establishing a community association for users, you may be able to reduce your liability if members of the association sign a waiver and/or contribute a membership fee to offset higher insurance costs. Talk to your insurer. Homeowners Associations have accomplished this in the past.</p></li>
