{% block steps %}
    <ol>
        <li><p>Get professional advice to determine the Chicago Municipal Code’s requirements on height, size, and property line setbacks.</p></li>
        <li><p>If you plan to have the public onto your privately-owned land, talk to your homeowner’s insurance company about changes to policy to protect yourself from liability.</p></li>
        <li><p>If you are an owner-occupant able to design and/or build it yourself to be code-compliant, you may be eligible to move forward without a registered architect/contractor through the Homeowner Assistance Permit.</p></li>
        <li><p>Talk to your design professional about whether your structure qualifies for the Easy Permit program, which requires a general contractor. You may need a Standard Plan Review Permit from the Department of Buildings, which requires both an architect and a general contractor.</p></li>
        <li><p>Structures within community gardens have special rules. Refer to the City’s Urban Agriculture FAQ’s.</p></li>
