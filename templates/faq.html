    <h3 id='faq-timeline'>Once I apply, how long will it take to hear back?</h3>
    <p>Applicants will receive information regarding the status of their application about 6 weeks after the application period has ended (around mid-March for applicants in Austin).</p>

    <h3 id='faq-evaluation'>How will applications be evaluated?</h3>
    <p>The main point of evaluation is to assess the completeness of the application and proof of ownership. If multiple requests are submitted for the same property the City will review on a case by case basis.</p>

    <h3 id='faq-how-many-times'>How many times can I apply?</h3>
    <p>Only <strong>one application</strong> will be accepted per property deed. If you own multiple properties in the pilot area, you can submit one application per property. If you have a deed with multiple grantors listed, only one application can be submitted.</p>

    <h3 id='faq-assistance'>Where can I get help in filling out my application?</h3>
    <p>You can get free assistance in filling out your application from City of Chicago staff downtown at the Department of Planning and Development.</p>

    <h3 id='faq-estimated-taxes'>How much in property taxes will I pay?</h3>
    <p>The amount of yearly property tax you will pay is determined by the <a href='http://www.cookcountyassessor.com/'>Cook County Assessor</a> and based on the <a href='http://www.cookcountyassessor.com/propertyvaluation.aspx'>assessed value</a> of the property and the tax rates for all local governments providing services in your community.</p>

    <p>To get a sense of what the property tax will be for your vacant lot, we took a look at the taxes paid for a few vacant lots sold by the City of Chicago:</p>

    <h3 id='faq-back-taxes'>Will I have to pay back taxes?</h3>
    <p>No you will not. When the lot is sold, no unpaid taxes by the previous owner will be transferred to you.</p>

    <h3 id='faq-lot-uses'>What can I do with the lot after I purchase it?</h3>
    <p>You must maintain the lot in accordance with the City of Chicago Municipal Code. See the sections on weeds, lot maintenance and fences:</p>

    <ul>
      <li><a href='http://chicagocode.org/7-28-120/'>7-28-120 Weeds – Penalty for violation – Abatement – Lien.<a/></li>
      <li><a href='http://chicagocode.org/7-28-740/'>7-28-740 Lot maintenance – Required.<a/></li>
      <li><a href='http://chicagocode.org/7-28-750/'>7-28-750 Noncombustible screen fence required – Nuisance declared when.</a></li>
    </ul>

    <strong>Residential development</strong><br />
    <p>Additionally, lots purchased from the Large Lot Program are all zoned Residential, meaning you may build on the lot as long as its in accordance with the <a href='http://chicagocode.org/17-2-0200/'>City of Chicago Zoning Ordinance on Residential lots</a>. Generally speaking, you may build a house or apartment building, but stores, offices, and factories are not allowed.</p>

    <h3 id='faq-block'>What defines a block?</h3>

    <p><img class='img-responsive img-thumbnail' src='/static/images/same-block.png' /></p>

    <p>Property owners can purchase a city-owned lot:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>On their side of the street</li>
      <li>Across the street</li>
      <li>Across the alley behind their property</li>
    </ul>

    <h3 id='faq-deed'>How do I download my deed from the Cook County Recorder of Deeds?</h3>
    <p>The <a href="http://12.218.239.81/i2/default.aspx" target="blank">Cook County Recorder of Deeds</a> holds records of property ownership. If your deed was dated <strong>before 1985</strong>, you will need to pick up your deed in person at <a href="https://www.google.com/maps/place/Cook+County+Recorder+of+Deeds/@41.883823,-87.63144,17z">118 N Clark St</a> and then scan or take a picture of it.</p>

    <p>If your deed is from <strong>after 1985</strong>, you can download a scanned version of your property deed by following these steps:

    <p><strong>1. Look up your Property Identification Number (PIN)</strong></p>

    <p>You will need to know the <strong>PIN</strong> of <i>your own</i> property. You can look it up by your address on <a href='http://cookcountypropertyinfo.com/Pages/PIN-Search.aspx'>CookCountyPropertyInfo.com</a>.</p>

    <p><a href='http://cookcountypropertyinfo.com/Pages/PIN-Search.aspx'><img class='img-responsive img-thumbnail' src='/static/images/ccpi-website.png' /></a></p>

    <p><strong>2. Search records under your PIN</strong></p>

    <p class="deed-explain">
      Enter your current PIN <a href="http://12.218.239.81/i2/default.aspx" target="blank">here</a> and click Search. You will see a list of various records associated with your PIN.
    </p>

    Click on the most recent <strong>DEED</strong> - this will likely be in the first row. Document details will show up on the right side of the page, and a scanned image of your deed will show up in a new window. If you do not see the scanned image, click View Images (make sure pop-ups are allowed).</p>

    <p>
      <img class='img-responsive img-thumbnail' src="/static/images/deed2.png"/>
    </p>

    <p><strong>4. Download your deed as a PDF (this costs $4.00)</strong></p>
